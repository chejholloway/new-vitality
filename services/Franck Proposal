Ill talk in USD for now so the numbers make more sense to you.

At last valuation the 20 acre beach front property including resort and sport centre is USD $10,050,000 and has appreciated at a rate of about $350,000 per year.

Of course ideally a cash sale as close as possible to the valuation price would be my preferred option since I plan to move to France for a while, however if this was too much to outlay for a buyer here is an option to purchase that I would like to put forward.

Reduce purchase price to USD $9,000,000 and owner financed over 7 years.
I would suggest taking over the current loan of $1,900,000 with BRED Bank.
If they do and BRED agree then obviously I would reduce again the actual sale price to $7,100,000
I would require a payment or deposit of $2,500,000 which would clear all small creditors as well as pay the capital gains tax from the sale. (currently there is zero stamp duty so it is a good time to buy)
Then a grace period of about 6 months can be allowed to work on the refinancing with the bank and transitional period.
Interest free monthly installments can then commence after the grace period has ended and I suggest something along the following

Year 1 ............. $20,000 / month
Year 2 .............$30,000 / month
Year 3 .............$40,000/ month
From the 4th to the 7th year the balance can either be paid monthly or in one go if they wish to clear things off.

These are my preliminary thoughts. In 7 years this property even without any further development will be close to $15,000,000 especially with there no longer being any freehold land on the beach so close to Suva our capital city. Moreover the availability of the 7 or so acres of free land to build on and the highway frontage for commercial development. This method is also a great way for a buyer to own a 20 acre chunk of paradise and a resort with great history and a bright future, and even put someone's dream beach house on the property.
